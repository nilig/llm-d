# P2P KV Cache Sharing

Well-lit path for peer-to-peer KV cache sharing: any vLLM instance pulls
cached prefix KV blocks directly from a peer's CPU offload tier instead of
recomputing them.

## Overview

This guide deploys `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with peer-to-peer KV cache sharing.
The transfer is CPU-to-CPU over NIXL (UCX/RDMA when available) - the source
pod's GPU is never touched, so serving a pull costs the source no prefill
capacity.

The deployment composes three llm-d capabilities:

* the vLLM `OffloadingConnector` with a P2P secondary tier (each pod is both
  a puller and a source),
* the llm-d Router's precise (KV-event-fed) prefix index, which the
  source decision consumes, and
* the `p2p-source-producer`, which stamps each request with the peer that
  holds the most cached prefix so the routing sidecar can inject
  `kv_transfer_params.remote_kv_source` and the engine pulls instead of
  recomputing.

In this example we deploy 16 TP=1 replicas on 16 GPUs (aggregated). A P/D
variant - pull on the prefill leg - is described at the end and reuses the
[P/D disaggregation guide](../pd-disaggregation/README.md)'s topology.

### When to use this path

P2P sharing pays wherever routing cannot (or should not) send every request
to the pod that already caches its prefix:

* **Load must spread.** A hot shared prefix saturates its cache owner under
  affinity routing; load-aware routing plus a pull spreads the work while
  preserving cache reuse.
* **The working set exceeds any single pod's cache.** With N pods each
  caching 1/N of the prefix pool, cross-pod requests either recompute or
  pull.
* **High session concurrency under a fixed ownership rule.** Many
  concurrent multi-turn sessions, each pinned by affinity to the pod that
  computed its prefix, can still queue behind a busy owner or spill to a
  colder pod that recomputes - independent of whether aggregate GPU
  capacity has room to spare. This guide's own document-Q&A headline is
  this case.
* **Long prefixes.** The pull is a near-constant-time CPU-to-CPU copy while
  recompute grows with length. Measure the crossover for your model (the
  benchmark below does); route pulls only above it.
* **Multi-turn sessions on P/D disaggregation.** Decode generates the
  session history, so on every subsequent turn the prefill worker faces KV
  it never computed and no routing decision can make local - without a pull
  it re-prefills the whole accumulated history each turn. The pull lets the
  prefill leg fetch decode's generated KV directly (see the
  [P/D variant](#pd-variant-p2p-over-nixl-disaggregation)). This is the
  regime with the largest measured gains, growing with history length and
  turn count - agentic sessions with 10K-100K-token contexts most of all:
  **6.3x median TTFT and +50% throughput** on a 2P+4D Qwen3-30B rig
  ([report](benchmark-results/qwen3-30b-h200-pd-agentic.md); the gains are
  median and throughput, not the extreme tail).
  Requires `offload_prompt_only: false` on decode and a chat template that
  re-renders generated answers verbatim (see Best Practices); models that
  drop reasoning content on re-render cannot reuse generated KV regardless
  of the serving stack.

What the pull is worth depends on the placement it sits behind, and the
three combinations this guide measures are not the same kind of thing:

* **Affinity + P2P - a fallback, not an established throughput feature,
  and not restart insurance.** Precise affinity sends each request to the
  pod that already holds its prefix, so a peer rarely leads by
  `minCachedTokenDelta` and there is rarely anything to fetch; the pull
  behaves as a fallback for the requests placement displaces. On the
  document-Q&A rig this arm reads +17% throughput and -26% p99 TTFT over
  affinity alone warm - inside that workload's 10-28% run-to-run spread
  with a single run per arm, so the guide does not credit the pull with a
  throughput role under affinity placement. A restarted ROUTER is
  explicitly not a case it covers: both indexes lose the pre-restart
  cache map - the approximate index learns only its own placements from
  birth, and the precise index consumes KV events delta-only with no
  replay - and both measured restart-recovery experiments produced zero
  pulls. A cold ENGINE replica behind an intact router is the plausible
  recovery case, and it is unmeasured.
* **Load-aware + P2P - a measured performance feature.** When placement
  deliberately scatters, the pull is what makes scattering affordable, and
  the gain is directly attributable to it.
* **P/D + P2P - a measured performance feature.** Decode generates the
  history, so the prefill leg faces KV no placement decision could have made
  local. This is the largest measured effect in the guide.

Between the two aggregated arms the ordering depends on the regime. On the
uniform shared-prefix pool (a working set spread wider than any one pod's
cache) affinity + P2P tracks offered rate to saturation and matches
affinity's near-ideal latency (p50 0.48 s at 30 req/s), while load-aware +
P2P runs a constant factor behind (p50 0.73 s, ~2% lower achieved) -
precise placement concentrates each prefix's traffic tightly enough that
requests hit locally, while scattering pays a pull on every displaced
request; the pull keeps that price sub-second (against a 63 s p50 recompute
floor without it), but affinity never pays it at all. On the document-Q&A
headline (128 concurrent multi-turn sessions, each pinned by affinity to
the pod that computed its prefix) the result flips: load-aware + P2P avoids
the owner-pod queueing that affinity + P2P still pays, giving +35%
throughput and a 1.5x better p99 TTFT than precise routing warm - and on a
cold fleet, zero client timeouts against 47-48 as affinity placement
collapses onto one pod (see
[benchmark-results/gpt-oss-120b-h200.md](benchmark-results/gpt-oss-120b-h200.md)).

The guide ships affinity + P2P as the default because it is the safer
placement in the capacity-driven regime, not because the pull improves it.
Reach for load-aware + P2P when your workload looks like many concurrent,
multi-turn sessions each pinned to an owner pod; re-measure both arms
against your own workload shape before assuming either generalizes. The
document-Q&A comparison is measured at the shipped `podCacheSize: 32`;
the uniform-pool comparison predates that setting, and correct sizing
improves affinity placement most, so its ordering (affinity ahead)
stands.

## Configuration

### Router scheduling configurations

Four EPP scheduling configurations ship with the guide (under
[benchmarking/](benchmarking/)). The recommended deployment is
`epp-affinity-p2p.yaml`; the others are the comparison arms the guide's
measurements use:

| Config | Placement | Pull |
|---|---|---|
| [`epp-affinity-p2p.yaml`](benchmarking/epp-affinity-p2p.yaml) | precise prefix-cache affinity | `p2p-source-producer`, `minCachedTokenDelta: 2048` (recommended - see the placement rule above) |
| [`epp-load-p2p.yaml`](benchmarking/epp-load-p2p.yaml) | load-balanced | `p2p-source-producer` (for high-concurrency, session-ownership-bound workloads) |
| [`epp-affinity.yaml`](benchmarking/epp-affinity.yaml) | precise prefix-cache affinity | none (baseline) |
| [`epp-load.yaml`](benchmarking/epp-load.yaml) | load-balanced | none (recompute control) |

`minCachedTokenDelta` is set from the measured pull-versus-recompute
crossover (see [Benchmarking](#benchmarking)): a pull is requested only when
a peer holds at least that many more cached prefix tokens than the scheduled
pod. The crossover is per model - 2,048 on this testbed (gpt-oss-120b and
Llama-8B both cross near or below 2K), 12,288 on the wide-EP GLM-5.2
testbed (753B; tie measured at ~8.7K tokens on the upstream tier, where the
pull floor is ~1.25 s flat against ~130-147 us/token of recompute) - so
re-measure it when
changing models, on a warmed pod pair (the first pull between two peers
pays a one-time session-establishment transient). The measurement is
automated as a calibration recipe:
[guides/recipes/router/calibration/calibrate-min-cached-token-delta.sh](../recipes/router/calibration/calibrate-min-cached-token-delta.sh)
runs it against two live pods and prints the recommended value.

### Supported Hardware Backends

* NVIDIA GPU / vLLM (measured on H200; any CUDA GPU with enough HBM for the
  model works). **Every benchmark in this guide was measured with `rdma/ib`
  exposed to the model-server containers**, and that is the recommended
  configuration. RDMA is not required for the feature to work - NIXL/UCX
  falls back to TCP - but the transport sets the pull-versus-recompute
  crossover, so it changes `minCachedTokenDelta` rather than whether the
  pull functions. On TCP the pull leg inflates while recompute is unchanged,
  moving the crossover from below 2K out to **between 16K and 32K tokens**
  (~29K on a finer sweep). Measured on gpt-oss-120b - TTFT delta,
  negative means the pull wins. The two columns are separate matched-build
  runs of the same method (each column internally consistent; the RDMA
  column is the canonical fixed-stack ladder in
  [benchmark-results/gpt-oss-120b-h200.md](benchmark-results/gpt-oss-120b-h200.md)),
  and the transport contrast between them is far larger than any
  build-to-build difference measured for this method:

  | prefix tokens | with `rdma/ib` (canonical) | without |
  |---:|---:|---:|
  | 2,048 | -55.8% | +26.7% |
  | 8,192 | -77.4% | +20.2% |
  | 16,384 | -83.2% | +10.9% |
  | 32,768 | -85.9% | -4.9% |
  | 49,152 | -88.2% | -15.3% |

  With RDMA the pull wins at every length measured, so `minCachedTokenDelta:
  2048` follows. Without it the pull loses below that crossover and wins
  above it, so the
  same deployment needs a `minCachedTokenDelta` an order of magnitude larger
  and only benefits workloads whose reused prefixes are that long. Check
  whether `rdma/ib` is present on your pods before reading the Step 0 ladder
  across, and derive the value from a crossover measured on your own
  transport.

## Best Practices

* `--block-size` identical on every pod AND in the router's
  `precise-prefix-cache-producer` (`tokenProcessorConfig.blockSize`). A
  mismatch leaves the prefix index empty and the whole path silently inert -
  requests still serve, nothing pulls.
* **Multi-pod data-parallel groups (LWS wide-EP) must compensate the
  socket base ports per pod.** vLLM binds the P2P tier and KV-events
  listeners at `configured base + global data_parallel_index`, while the
  router addresses `pod IP + pod-local rank` - correct when each pod is
  its own DP group (every topology in this guide), wrong for worker pods
  of a multi-pod group, where a mis-addressed pull does not fall back to
  recompute but stalls the request until the client times out. Each pod
  subtracts its global start rank from both configured bases so every
  pod binds the same pod-local ranges:

  ```bash
  START_RANK=$(( ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX:-0} * DP_SIZE_LOCAL ))
  P2P_BASE=$((7777 - START_RANK))        # P2P secondary tier port
  KV_EVENTS_BASE=$((5557 - START_RANK))  # KV-events publisher endpoint
  ```

  Router-side, per-rank source selection additionally requires the EPP to
  attribute KV events to the publishing rank's serving endpoint
  ([llm-d-router#2233](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/pull/2233),
  merged) and the sidecar to compare full endpoints in its self-pull
  guard ([llm-d-router#2234](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/pull/2234),
  in review) - run a router release or build that carries both before
  enabling the pull on such a topology. The wide-EP measurements in this
  guide's GLM results page ran images built from those two changes.
* `--kv-events-config` on every serving pod, topic
  `kv@<POD_IP>:<PORT>@<model>`. No events, no precise index, no source
  selection.
  `<PORT>` must be the port the router identifies the endpoint by - the
  routing sidecar's port (`8000` in this guide), not the engine port
  (`8200`). The EPP attributes each event's cached blocks to an endpoint
  by matching the topic's `<POD_IP>:<PORT>` against the InferencePool
  endpoint; a mismatch (e.g. tagging the engine port) leaves the index
  empty for every real endpoint, so `bestCachedTokens` is always 0 and no
  pull ever fires - silently, exactly like "no effect". This bites when
  adapting the manifest to a different port layout, not the shipped one.
* `PYTHONHASHSEED` pinned to the same value fleet-wide. vLLM seeds block
  hashes per process; unpinned seeds mean no block hash ever matches across
  pods and every lookup misses.
* Matched TP between peers that serve each other. The peer session
  fingerprint embeds the parallel layout, so a TP-mismatched pair rejects
  the session and requests silently recompute. Hetero-TP is supported only
  for non-hybrid-attention models on the V1 model runner
  (`VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=0` where V2 is the default); in-review
  upstream work stores offloaded KV in a canonical parallelism-free layout
  ([vllm#48414](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48414)),
  removing the TP coupling.
* `offload_prompt_only` set to match what peers can use. Prompt-side
  prefix pulls work under either setting; `false` additionally offloads
  *generated* KV (session answers) so a conversation's full history is
  pullable - pair it with an index that covers decode blocks (the precise
  one) and a chat template that re-renders answers verbatim. This guide's
  deployment runs `false`; the wide-EP testbed runs `true` because its
  model drops reasoning on re-render, so generated KV is unreachable for
  reuse regardless.
* CPU tier (`cpu_bytes_to_use`) considerably larger than the per-pod GPU
  KV cache - 2x as the working default. The tier's value is the KV that
  GPU evicts and CPU *retains* (the
  [tiered path's](../../docs/well-lit-paths/foundations/tiered-prefix-cache.md)
  receptive field): a tier smaller than the GPU cache mostly duplicates
  blocks that are still GPU-resident, and the router's view of "who has
  this prefix" outruns what sources can actually serve.
  * **Compute the ratio from measured KV capacity, not per-GPU
    intuition - TP changes it drastically.** Model weights are paid once
    per pod while KV memory scales with the TP degree, so per-pod KV
    capacity grows superlinearly with TP. gpt-oss-120b on H200 at
    `--gpu-memory-utilization=0.85`: TP=1 leaves ~55 GB of KV (~1.4M
    tokens), but TP=4 leaves ~414 GB (~10M tokens). A 128 GiB tier is
    2.3x the GPU cache at TP=1 and 0.33x at TP=4 - large-looking, yet
    unable to hold even the GPU's own evictions. Read the KV capacity
    from the engine startup log and size the tier from it, per role.
  * Size `/dev/shm` above `cpu_bytes_to_use` (the tier is an shm mmap)
    and the pod memory limit above both - the memory-backed emptyDir
    counts against the pod's limit.
  * With data parallelism (`--data-parallel-size` N > 1), each DP
    replica gets its own tier region and P2P port: `/dev/shm` must
    exceed N x `cpu_bytes_to_use`, and rank `r`'s P2P tier listens on
    the configured port + `r`. Requires vLLM with per-DP-rank P2P
    ports and per-replica offload regions
    ([vllm#47636](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47636),
    [vllm#47987](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47987)).
* Size the render service for the request rate. The router's
  `token-producer` calls the render endpoint
  (`/v1/completions/render`) once per request to tokenize the full
  prompt; at ~50K-token prompts one render replica is effectively
  single-core-bound and saturates near 10 req/s. Past saturation every
  request stalls for exactly the token-producer `vllm.timeout` (default
  5s) before routing proceeds without token IDs - prefix scoring is
  silently disabled while engines sit idle. Provision roughly
  `peak_req_per_s x per-request tokenize seconds` in replicas (a 50K
  random-text prompt costs ~0.1s) and alert on flat TTFT plateaus at
  the timeout value.
* Set an explicit client timeout in benchmark workloads
  (`load.request_timeout`); compare stage wall-clock to send-window +
  drain, not to the offered duration.

## Prerequisites

- Have the [proper client tools installed on your local system](../../helpers/client-setup/README.md) to use this guide.
- Checkout llm-d repo:

```bash
  export branch="main" # branch, tag, or commit hash
  git clone https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d.git && cd llm-d && git checkout ${branch}
```

- Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export REPO_ROOT=$(realpath $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))
source ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/env.sh
export GUIDE_NAME="p2p-kv-cache-sharing"
export NAMESPACE="llm-d-${GUIDE_NAME}"
```

- Install the Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/download/${GAIE_VERSION}/v1-manifests.yaml
```

- Create a target namespace for the installation

```bash
kubectl create namespace ${NAMESPACE} --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Additional requirements specific to this path:

* A vLLM image with the `OffloadingConnector` P2P secondary tier.
* llm-d routing sidecar with `kv_transfer_params.remote_kv_source` injection
  (the branch renamed the sub-dict keys on 2026-07-20; a sidecar emitting the
  old `p2p`/`prefill`/`decode` keys against the current branch is silently
  inert - see Troubleshooting).

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Prepare HF Token

Create the `llm-d-hf-token` secret in the namespace. The router reads
`HF_TOKEN` to reach gated tokenizers - `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is public but
the secret makes swapping in a gated model a no-op. See
[helpers/hf-token.md](../../helpers/hf-token.md) for the full helper.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your HuggingFace token>
kubectl create secret generic llm-d-hf-token \
  --from-literal="HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN}" \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### 2. Deploy the llm-d Router

Install the router with this guide's values, which deploy the EPP with the
affinity + P2P scheduling configuration (`epp-affinity-p2p.yaml`) as the
default. To run a comparison arm instead, swap the `pluginsCustomConfig` in
the values for `epp-affinity.yaml`, `epp-load.yaml`, or `epp-load-p2p.yaml`
from [benchmarking/](benchmarking/).

```bash
helm upgrade -i ${GUIDE_NAME} \
  ${ROUTER_STANDALONE_CHART} \
  -f ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/router/base.values.yaml \
  -f ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/${GUIDE_NAME}/router/${GUIDE_NAME}.values.yaml \
  -n ${NAMESPACE} --version ${ROUTER_CHART_VERSION}
```

#### Deploy the Render (Tokenizer) Service

The EPP `token-producer` tokenizes prompts by calling vLLM's
`/v1/completions/render` endpoint, served from a dedicated horizontally
scalable Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -k ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/${GUIDE_NAME}/render
```

Size it per the [Best Practices](#best-practices) render bullet - long-prompt
workloads need more replicas than the default.

### 3. Deploy the Model Server

Apply the Kustomize overlay for your transport:

```bash
export ACCELERATOR_TYPE=gpu   # options: gpu
export MODEL_SERVER=vllm      # options: vllm
export TRANSPORT=rdma         # options: rdma (recommended), base
kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -k ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/${GUIDE_NAME}/modelserver/${ACCELERATOR_TYPE}/${MODEL_SERVER}/${TRANSPORT}/
```

16 replicas, TP=1, `--block-size=64`, KV events on, the offloading connector
with a P2P tier on port 7777.

- **`rdma`** adds an `rdma/ib` device and `IPC_LOCK` to every model server.
  This is what every benchmark in this guide was measured on, and it is the
  recommended overlay.
- **`base`** is the same deployment without the IB device. NIXL/UCX falls
  back to TCP, which does not stop the pull working - it moves the
  pull-versus-recompute crossover from below 2K tokens out to ~29K, so
  `minCachedTokenDelta` has to move with it. See
  [Supported Hardware Backends](#supported-hardware-backends).

The `rdma/ib` resource name is what the clusters this was measured on expose;
yours may differ (`rdma/hca`, `nvidia.com/rdma`, ...). Check before applying,
and edit `modelserver/gpu/vllm/rdma/patch-rdma.yaml` to match:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.allocatable}' | tr ',' '\n' | grep -i rdma
```

Confirm the device actually reached the container - a pod that schedules
without it serves requests normally and just pulls slowly, so this failure
looks like a performance result rather than a misconfiguration:

```bash
kubectl exec -n ${NAMESPACE} deploy/p2p-kv-cache-sharing-decode -c modelserver -- ls /dev/infiniband
```

#### Engine image: upstream nightly pins

The `OffloadingConnector` P2P secondary tier is upstream in vLLM
([vllm#48021](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48021)); no source
overlay is required. All three robustness fixes are upstream as well: the
finalization and reconnect crash fixes
([vllm#49671](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49671),
[vllm#49823](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49823)) and the
symmetric-fetch stall fix under sustained many-to-many pull load
([vllm#49877](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49877)). Any
nightly at or after `nightly-6f91edf96d3f3272945809c04702380053bff4de`
(2026-07-29, the first containing all four) works; the kustomization pins
that one so the guide's numbers stay reproducible. Prefer a tagged vLLM
release over any nightly once the tier ships in one.

### 4. Calibrate `minCachedTokenDelta` for your model and transport

The shipped EPP configs set `minCachedTokenDelta: 2048`, the crossover
measured for this guide's reference setup (gpt-oss-120b on H200 with
`rdma/ib`). The crossover is model-, hardware- and transport-specific, so on
any other combination measure your own against the pods you just deployed
and set it on the `p2p-source-producer` in the router values:

```bash
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE} \
POD_SELECTOR=llm-d.ai/guide=p2p-kv-cache-sharing \
MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-oss-120b \
${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/router/calibration/calibrate-min-cached-token-delta.sh
```

The recipe prints the recommended value; re-apply the router release with it
and restart the EPP. See
[Calibrating `minCachedTokenDelta`](../recipes/router/calibration/README.md#calibrating-mincachedtokendelta)
for what it measures and its prerequisites.

### 5. (Optional) Enable Monitoring

- Install the [Monitoring stack](../../docs/operations/observability/setup.md).
- To enable Prometheus monitoring on the llm-d router, add `-f ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/router/features/monitoring.values.yaml` during the [router installation step](#2-deploy-the-llm-d-router).
- Deploy the monitoring resources for model servers:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -k ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/recipes/modelserver/components/monitoring
  ```

## Verification

### 1. Get the IP of the Proxy

```bash
export IP=$(kubectl get service ${GUIDE_NAME}-epp -n ${NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
```

### 2. Send Test Requests

```bash
kubectl run curl-debug --rm -it \
    --image=cfmanteiga/alpine-bash-curl-jq \
    --namespace="$NAMESPACE" \
    --env="IP=$IP" \
    -- curl -X POST http://${IP}:8081/v1/completions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "prompt": "How are you today?"}'
```

### 3. Mechanism-engaged gates

An inert misconfiguration looks identical to "no effect" - requests serve
fine, nothing pulls. Run every gate before trusting any measurement:

1. **Index populated**: the EPP logs show KV-event subscriptions for every
   pod; a scheduling decision logs non-zero prefix scores.
2. **Header firing**: the routing sidecar logs
   `running P2P source protocol` with a `source_host` on requests whose
   prefix a peer holds.
3. **Pulls landing**: `vllm:external_prefix_cache_hits_total` rises on
   pulling pods; the source logs the served fetch.
4. **Hash agreement**: seed one pod with a prefix, request it on another
   with the header; a hit of ~the full prefix length proves block hashes
   match (if this is zero, check `PYTHONHASHSEED` and `--block-size`).

## Benchmarking

This guide uses [`llmdbenchmark`](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark) - the supported standard CLI for llm-d performance benchmarking.

### 1. Install the `llmdbenchmark` CLI

This guide's workload profile lands via
[llm-d-benchmark#1656](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark/pull/1656),
which is open, so `guide_p2p-kv-cache-sharing_1.yaml` is absent from `main`
and the PR branch lives on a fork rather than on `origin`. Check out the
pinned PR commit; replace the fetch with the merge commit on `main` once
the PR lands.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark/main/install.sh | bash
cd llm-d-benchmark
# Until llm-d-benchmark#1656 merges the profile comes from the PR fork at the
# pinned commit - `origin` has neither the branch nor the file.
git fetch https://github.com/nilig/llm-d-benchmark.git \
    960f55a910fc4c049428b820b54462227dfda510
git checkout 960f55a910fc4c049428b820b54462227dfda510
source .venv/bin/activate
llmdbenchmark --version
```

### 2. Resolve the endpoint of the stack you just deployed

```bash
export ENDPOINT_URL="http://$(kubectl get service ${GUIDE_NAME}-epp -n ${NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'):8081"
export GATEWAY_CLASS=epponly # standalone mode
```

### 3. Run the benchmark profile for P2P KV Cache Sharing

`guide_p2p-kv-cache-sharing_1.yaml` is the workload profile shipped with
`llm-d-benchmark` for this guide - an analogous document-Q&A workload;
the canonical tables were measured with a custom driver (see
[benchmarking/README.md](benchmarking/README.md)). Run it once per
routing arm, switching only the EPP configuration between runs:

```bash
llmdbenchmark \
    --spec           guides/p2p-kv-cache-sharing \
    run \
    --endpoint-url   "${ENDPOINT_URL}" \

## Cleanup

```bash
helm uninstall ${GUIDE_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}
kubectl delete -n ${NAMESPACE} -k ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/${GUIDE_NAME}/modelserver/${ACCELERATOR_TYPE}/${MODEL_SERVER}/${TRANSPORT}/
kubectl delete -n ${NAMESPACE} -k ${REPO_ROOT}/guides/${GUIDE_NAME}/render
```

## How It Works

1. **Model server pods publish KV-cache events** and run the
   `OffloadingConnector` with a CPU tier plus a P2P secondary tier: every
   pod both offloads its computed KV to CPU and serves it to peers on the
   P2P port.
2. **The router builds its prefix index** - in this deployment the precise
   one from the KV events - so it knows per request which pods hold which
   prefix blocks.
3. **The `p2p-source-producer` compares** the best-cached peer against the
   pod scheduling actually picked; when the peer leads by at least
   `minCachedTokenDelta` tokens it sets the KV cache source header.
4. **The routing sidecar injects `kv_transfer_params.remote_kv_source`** from the header
   and the engine pulls the prefix blocks from the peer's CPU tier over
   NIXL - hits load as normal cache hits and ordinary misses recompute, so a
   request whose peer simply does not have the blocks degrades to baseline
   behavior rather than failing.

   > [!WARNING]
   > That fallback covers ordinary misses, not a write that never lands. On
   > the engine pinned by this guide a block left in `HIT_PENDING` has no
   > deadline, so a request waiting on it can stay deferred until the client
   > times out rather than recomputing. Treat a stalled `HIT_PENDING` as a
   > known limitation of this path on current engines.

## P/D variant: P2P over NIXL disaggregation

Measured on this topology: **6.3x median TTFT and +50% throughput** against
plain NIXL P/D on a multi-turn agentic workload -
[full report](benchmark-results/qwen3-30b-h200-pd-agentic.md).

Under P/D disaggregation the pull applies to the **prefill leg only**: the
prefill worker computes the prompt KV and streams it to the decoder, so
that is the leg where recomputing a cached prefix is wasted work. The EPP
evaluates the source header against the prefill profile's target, and the
sidecar injects `kv_transfer_params.remote_kv_source` onto the prefill leg; the decode
leg already receives the full KV over NIXL and has nothing to pull.

Start from the [P/D disaggregation guide](../pd-disaggregation/README.md)
topology and change three things:

1. **Engines run `MultiConnector`** - NIXL carries the P/D transfer, the
   OffloadingConnector provides the CPU tier and the P2P listener. Same
   config on both legs (a pod serves pulls regardless of role):

   ```json
   {"kv_connector":"MultiConnector","kv_role":"kv_both",
    "kv_connector_extra_config":{"connectors":[
      {"kv_connector":"NixlConnector","kv_role":"kv_both"},
      {"kv_connector":"OffloadingConnector","kv_role":"kv_both",
       "kv_connector_extra_config":{"spec_name":"TieringOffloadingSpec",
        "cpu_bytes_to_use":94489280512,"offload_prompt_only":false,
        "secondary_tiers":[{"type":"p2p","host":"$(POD_IP)","port":7777}]}}]}}
   ```

   Both side channels must bind the pod IP via the downward API:
   `VLLM_NIXL_SIDE_CHANNEL_HOST` and `VLLM_P2P_SIDE_CHANNEL_HOST`. All
   other prerequisites from [Best Practices](#best-practices) (block size,
   `PYTHONHASHSEED`, `offload_prompt_only: false`, CPU-tier sizing) apply
   unchanged - and size `cpu_bytes_to_use` **per role**: decode legs
   typically run higher TP, so their per-pod GPU KV (and therefore the
   tier that must exceed it) is several times a prefill pod's. The value
   in the example above is a prefill-leg (TP=1) size; see the CPU-tier
   bullet in Best Practices for the TP arithmetic.

2. **The routing sidecar declares the tier** with
   `--kv-connector=nixlv2 --enable-p2p-pull` (plus
   `--p2p-connector-port=7777` if not the default). `--enable-p2p-pull` is
   accepted only with `--kv-connector=nixlv2`; the sidecar rejects it with
   any other connector at startup (with `--kv-connector=offloading` the
   tier is native and the flag is unnecessary).

3. **The EPP scheduling config targets the prefill profile**: set the
   `p2p-source-producer`'s `prefillProfileName` to the disaggregation
   prefill profile name (default `prefill`), so the source comparison runs
   against the pod that will actually compute the prefix.

Size the decode pool for its NIXL intake - each request ships its full KV
from prefill to decode, and that intake, not prefill placement, is
typically the topology's ceiling.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No pulls, everything serves; EPP logs `bestCachedTokens:0` for every request | index empty: block-size mismatch, missing kv-events, or the kv-events topic port does not match the router's endpoint port (Best Practices, kv-events bullet) - or hashes disagree (`PYTHONHASHSEED`) | verification gates 1 and 4 |
| `rejecting peer connect: block_len mismatch` | `--block-size` differs between pods | align it everywhere |
| No pulls from a TP-mismatched source, index and hashes fine | peer session fingerprint is TP-locked | matched TP; hetero-TP only for non-hybrid models on the V1 runner (Best Practices) |
| Pulls fire but hit rate ~0 | CPU tier too small vs GPU cache; prefixes evicted before peers ask | grow `cpu_bytes_to_use` (and `/dev/shm`) |
| Sidecar exits with `unknown flag: --enable-p2p-pull` | sidecar image predates the NIXL PD pull path | use a sidecar build that includes it |
| Zero pulls after moving to the current connector branch, gates 1-2 pass | sidecar emits the old sub-dict keys (`p2p`/`prefill`/`decode`); the renamed engine ignores them | use a sidecar built with the renamed keys (`remote_kv_source`/`remote_prefiller`/`remote_decoder`) |
| TTFT pins flat at ~the token-producer timeout (default 5s) at every rate above some cliff, engines report near-zero queue/prefill time, both arms identical | render service saturated; every EPP render call times out and requests proceed late without token IDs | scale render replicas to `peak_req_per_s x tokenize seconds per request`; verify with a direct load test against `/v1/completions/render` |

  for provenance, and the pull-versus-recompute crossover used to set the
  production threshold.
