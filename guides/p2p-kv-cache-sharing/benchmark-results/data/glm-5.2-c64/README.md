# GLM-5.2 C64 fixed-window data

This directory contains byte-for-byte copies of the exact-window request
summaries used for the
2-prefill/2-decode C64 tables in
[../../glm-5.2-h200.md](../../glm-5.2-h200.md). The benchmark ran on August
13, 2026 with new engine pod UIDs for every arm.

The files preserve the full metric precision exported by the analysis:

* `four-arm-exact-window.json` contains the DEBUG observation of approximate
  and precise routing, each with and without P2P.
* `repeat-approx-first-exact-window.json` contains the approximate-without-P2P
  then precise+P2P repeat.
* `repeat-precise-first-exact-window.json` contains the reversed-order
  precise+P2P then approximate-without-P2P repeat.
* `three-pair-aggregate.json` combines the baseline and candidate from the
  four-arm observation with both repeats and records the per-metric means,
  medians, population coefficients of variation, and paired changes.

The four-arm source campaign is `maroon-c64-20260813-174030`; both repeats
belong to `maroon-c64-repeats-20260813-185900`. The copied source checksums
are:

Each source workload uses the same AIPerf configuration documented in
[../../../benchmarking/README.md](../../../benchmarking/README.md): 48 entries
from `semianalysis_cc_traces_weka_062126`, concurrency 64, seed 67, a
300-second admission window, and a 120-second drain. A request enters these
files only if it reaches a terminal state by
`min(credit_issued_ns) + 300 seconds`; later drain completions are excluded.

For throughput metric `x`, the paired percentage change is
`100 * (precise_p2p / approximate - 1)`. Latency changes use the same formula,
so a negative value is an improvement. The four router configurations are
committed in the benchmarking directory next to its README.

The per-request AIPerf records, rank time series, and DEBUG engine logs are not
part of this compact bundle. These files support recomputing every throughput
and latency value in the published C64 tables, but not re-running the
exact-window extraction from individual requests.
